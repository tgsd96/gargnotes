The code for the gargnotes.heroku.com<br>

Here is the code of my website- gargnotes.heroku.com<br>

The site runs on django framework, so the server is running python.<br>
Specifications are:<br>
  Django-1.7.4<br>
  Python-2.7.4<br>
When you clone the repository, take care to comment out #DATABASES['default'] = dj_database_url.config() in settings.py
and run python manage.py migrate to create the database,
also run python manage.py createsuperuser to use admin.<br>
There is still some work remaining in the project.<br>
Like adding tags, providing better sharing in posts.<br>
<br><br>
Read docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7 for understanding how django works.<br>
If the code comes handy in your development, don't forget to say "Thanks".
